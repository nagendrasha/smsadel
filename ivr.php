    <div style="color: blue;width: 80px;border: 2px solid blue; margin-left: 0;"></div>
    <p class="mt-4"> <b>24x7 Customer Support</b></p>
    <p>With IVR, you can provide your customers with a way to connect with your business at any hour of the day. When
        customers call on your IVR number, they can choose from the options available in your IVR menu.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">Based on customer’s inputs, the IVR service automatically routes the calls to the relevant person in
        your team. And if the agents are not available, customers are provided with an option to leave a voice message
        so that your agents can get back to them once they come online.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">With an IVR number, your business stays up 24*7 and that’s the route to greater customer
        satisfaction, improvising brand loyalty.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4"><b>Customized Greetings</b></p>
    <p>Customer experience and branding play an important role in making a business successful. With an IVR service, you
        can attain both; customer experience as well as branding. </p>
    <p>Under the IVR menu, you can set up personalized customer greetings. When your customer will call you, they will
        hear something like “Welcome to [Your Business Name]. Let us know how we can help you.” IVR service makes your
        business support system work like a breeze providing your customers with the luxury to connect with you in
        seconds.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">Level Up Productivity</p>
    <p>With the help of a smart IVR menu, a huge pile of customer queries can be handled with automation. Thanks to the
        input handling capabilities of IVR, primary information required to provide support like customer name, customer
        ID, phone number, etc. can be taken care of without any need of agents. </p>

    <p>By the time the call is routed to a real support agent, all this information is already available on their
        screen. IVR services make sure that 100% time of your support agents is spent in solving real customer problems
        rather than performing redundant tasks like collecting name, phone number, and email address of the customers.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4"><b>Handle Large Call Volumes</b></p>
    <p>IVR enables even small support teams to handle large numbers of customer calls by independently dealing with
        incoming queries and smartly routing calls to the right person in the right department.
    </p>

    <p>For example, if a customer wants to check only the balance in the account, this task can be automated with IVR
        without bothering the support agents. If a customer needs help with a product, her call can be transferred to
        the relevant agent in the support department. If the call is for help with billing, it can be routed to the
        sales team, all with the help of an IVR service. </p>
    <p>A cloud-based IVR service automates a large part of the call handling process making it possible to take care of
        any number of calls.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Turn Callers Into Customers</p>
    <p>An efficient IVR service can also work as a good sales channel too. And with the help of a custom IVR menu, you
        can use the IVR service as a lead generation channel along with live support.</p>

    <p>On your IVR number, you can ask callers a series of questions and qualified callers can be connected with the
        sales agents. With IVR calls, you can partly automate the process of interacting with new prospects, converting
        your first-time callers into customers. </p>
    <p>The delicate balance between technology and the human touch provided by an IVR service makes it a unique channel
        for customer interaction lead conversion.
